    <title>The trinity of front-end quality</title>

    <h1>The trinity of front-end quality</h1>
    <p>
      There are three main end goals that front-end developers keep striving
      for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accessibility</li>
      <li>Performance</li>
      <li>SEO</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>SEO(Search Engine Optimatization)</h2>
    <p>
      Refers to making sure your website is rankend relevantly high on search
      engines's SERPs, like google's. Because the exact rules checked by search
      engines are not entirely public, and competition for popular queries is so
      fierce, SEO is often referred toas black magic... and well, sometimes it
      does feel like it is! But there are very clear best practices to apply to
      be respected and taken seriously by Google and its friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making your markup as semantic as you can will help the search engine
      understand your webpage: but by now, most websites do that right , so it
      is definitely not going to be enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      More current strategies involve the content you put in your website, the
      urls, the internal and / or external linking, the website
      performance,...The list of things that can be done to improve one's SEO os
      endless!
    </p>
    <p>
      To monitor SEO results, one should use monitoring tools which are going to
      keep track of search engineranking continuously for them in various
      countries. Most tools are paid, but there a few free ones with the most
      limited features. Many of those tools are also meant to help define the
      right SEO strategy in the first place, when you try to figure out which
      queries you should be optimizing for(a step called
      <i>keyword research</i>). For instance, if the tool tells you that a query
      doesn't involve many competitors fighting for it, yet Google Trends tells
      you it is a query that is heavily being ran by Google users, then you
      might be sitting on a goldmine!
    </p>
    <p>
      Another important note to keep in mind is that a SEO strategy will of
      course contain the <i>targeted queries</i> of someone actively looking for
      you(for insatnce, Safeway probably works hard to be ranked high on the
      "safeway" query), but also the <i>untargeted queries</i> of someone who is
      not specifically looking for you, but whose attention you seek(for
      instance, safeway probably works even harder to be ranked high on the "San
      francisco grocery store" query, or one even more competitive: just
      "grocery store", if its relevant for them). Deciding which queries make
      sense to pursue is a critical component of SEO strategy.
    </p>
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      In real life, it is estimated that a website may lose as high as 15% of
      its visitors to bad accessibility. Think: someone with poor eyesight who
      couldn't read the menu button properly because of their low contrast, and
      gave up; or someone who worked hard with their hands today, and can't
      handle the mouse anymore to fill in a long form, and the keyboard
      navigation won't work...
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a semantic and valid HTML markup will already go you long way to
      make one's website accessible; but it is definitely not enough, and issues
      are hidden in the detail(images, colours...)
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, for complex applications for which you feel like some bits of the
      page should be more explict in their purpose, you can give that extra
      information with WAI-ARIA(often referred to as just "ARIA").
    </p>
    <h3><em>The specific case of newtork fault-tolerance.</em></h3>
    <p>
      Another kind of loss of accessibility is when resources(such as CSS files,
      images, javascript files) are in accessible, such as for net work reasons.
      Without CSS,without JavaScript files, without images, your website should
      still work. It may not have much styling and interactivity, but people
      must still be able to post that micro-blogging status, for instance.
      Browsers often have built-in tools(or plugins) that allow you to see your
      website without images, without CSS, without JavaScript,..
    </p>
    <h2>Front-end performance</h2>
    <p>
      Did you know that over 90% of time spent by a user waiting for your
      webpage is happening in the front-end, rather than the back-end? The
      reasons are pretty obvious when you think about it: you can host your code
      on faster servers, or scale it on a higher number of them; but there's
      nothing you can do to make the user's brower environment better. To ensure
      all browers can interpret it, you have to send your code that respects web
      standards(which are sometimes verbose), and you can't make that code
      smaller than the standards allowed. It has to go through the network, be
      it entirely loaded and run by the browser, you can't have the browser
      "preload" anything. Well, actualy...
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many pitfalls and tricks to address web performance. Always
      attempt to either make each file smaller, or to lower the number of
      files(it is magnitudes more expensive to dowload two files of 50kB each,
      than one file of 100kB).
      <em>Some pitfalls:</em>
      <li>
        Forgetting to enable GZip and set Cache expirations on your web server's
        configuration
      </li>
      <li>
        Using many external JavaScript libraries, including some you absolutely
        didn't need
      </li>
      <li>Using huge images displayed smaller</li>
      <li>Leaving the metadata in your images</li>
      <em>Some tricks:</em>
      <li>Image sprites</li>
      <li>
        No CSS or JS inside the HTML(.js and .css files will be cached on first
        call, won't have to be downloaded next time)
      </li>
      <li>
        Ajax calls that can be done with GET HTTP verb should use it (that way,
        they are cached)
      </li>
      <li>CSS and JS files are concatenated into one single file each</li>
      <li>CSS and JS files are "minified"</li>
      <li>Images are recompressed</li>
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual with quality, you will want to measure. But there are many ways
      to measure a front-end's load time. Should it be the Time To First Byte?
      Page load Time? Time To First Paint? You should define your strategy, and
      monitor the measure you feel are relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, the way measures are done is:
      <li>
        The cache is cleared, the page is loaded, and the measurements are
        noted. The operation is done three times-If one is very significantly
        apart to the others, it is removed, to account for potential network
        issues unrelated to the website. The final result is the average of
        remaining calls.
      </li>
      <li>
        The page is loaded without clearing the cache, and the measurements
        noted. Again, three times, removing every significantly wrong measures,
        and the final result is the average. How to measure,you ask? Just use
        the performance measuring tools that are likely to be in your browser.
      </li>
